Multiecuscan is a popular diagnostic software for Italian cars, such as Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Lancia and others. It allows you to perform various diagnostics tasks on the supported vehicles/modules, such as reading and clearing fault codes, performing tests and adjustments, and more. Multiecuscan works on Windows computers with various interfaces, such as ELM327, OBDKey, OBDLink, CANtieCAR and others.
 
But what if you want to use Multiecuscan on your Android device, such as a smartphone or a tablet? Is it possible? The answer is yes, but you need a special app called Android39. Android39 is an app that allows you to run Windows applications on your Android device. It works by creating a virtual machine that emulates a Windows environment on your device. You can then install and run any Windows application that is compatible with Android39.
