## Troubleshooting
 
If you encounter any problems while flashing your phone, here are some tips to help you:

- If Miracle Box does not detect your phone, try changing the USB port or cable. Make sure you have installed the correct USB driver for your phone on your computer.
- If Miracle Box shows an error message or stops responding during flashing, try restarting the software or your computer. Make sure you have enough free space on your computer and close any other programs that may interfere with Miracle Box.
- If your phone does not boot up after flashing, try doing a factory reset by pressing and holding the power button and volume down button together until you see a recovery menu. Then select wipe data/factory reset and confirm. This will erase all your data but may fix some software issues.
