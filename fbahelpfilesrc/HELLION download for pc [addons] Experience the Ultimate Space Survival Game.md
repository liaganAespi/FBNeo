## HELLION Tips and Tricks
 
HELLION is a challenging game that requires you to master the skills of space survival, such as navigation, resource management, combat, and exploration. Here are some tips and tricks that can help you survive and thrive in the harsh environment of HELLION:

- Turn off your FTL right after a jump or when not in use as this will drain massive amounts of power[^3^]. Do not message someone while warping, press tab to exit ship controls first or it will cancel warp. If your warp timer is set to 0, just click zoom to parent to fix it[^3^].
- Crew Quarters Modules have a secure storage area, enter the cryopod and look up to see a switch. Fresh start will not see it, walk into the outpost and back[^2^]. The starting block of your station will supply the air to modules without their own air support. Use a LSM because it has more storage and can use more filters at once[^2^].
- Lock your airlock modules so only owners of the cryopod on that station and/or people on the crew manifest can operate the door. Crew manifest can be found in the cockpit of a ship and the Command Module[^2^]. The Cargo Bay Module work area will always stay unpressurized use this to your advantage after long mining runs to quickly unload. It also has a massive internal storage[^2^].
- Turrets will respond to crew manifests to designate friend or foe, add your crew before installing them. Others like you also viewed New Player's Guide Ships/Arges MKII[^2^]. Be careful when approaching other stations or ships, as they may have hostile turrets or players waiting for you.
- Learn how to use the navigation system and the orbital mechanics of HELLION. You can use the map screen to plot courses, scan for signals, and warp to different locations. You can also use the RCS thrusters and the docking mode to maneuver your ship or station in space. Be aware of your velocity, altitude, and orbit stability at all times.
- Manage your resources wisely and always have backups. You will need oxygen, nitrogen, fuel, power, ammo, food, water, and medical supplies to survive. You can find these resources by looting derelict ships and stations, mining asteroids and planets, or trading with other players. You can also craft some items using the fabricator or the 3D printer.
- Explore the secrets of HELLION and discover its lore. You can find clues and hints in data logs, audio recordings, emails, and other documents scattered around the world. You can also encounter anomalies, events, and mysteries that will challenge your curiosity and courage.

HELLION is a game that rewards skill, creativity, and cooperation. You can play solo or with friends, but remember that you are not alone in this hostile universe. Whether you choose to be a friend or a foe, a miner or a pirate, a explorer or a settler, HELLION offers you a unique space survival experience.
