## Tips and Tricks to Improve Your Gameplay
 
Playing Age of Empires 2 HD cracked online-multiplayer can be a lot of fun, but it can also be very challenging, especially if you face skilled opponents. To improve your gameplay and increase your chances of winning, you need to learn some tips and tricks that can give you an edge over your enemies. Here are some of them:

- Learn the hotkeys. Hotkeys are keyboard shortcuts that allow you to perform actions faster and more efficiently. For example, you can use hotkeys to select buildings, train units, research technologies, and issue commands. You can customize your hotkeys in the game options or use the default ones. Learning the hotkeys will save you a lot of time and mouse clicks.
- Use control groups. Control groups are a way of assigning numbers to units or buildings for easy selection. For example, you can assign your scout to control group 1 by selecting it and pressing Ctrl+1. Then, you can select it again by pressing 1. You can use control groups for your army, your town center, your barracks, and any other important unit or building. This will help you manage your base and your troops more effectively.
- Scout the map. Scouting is essential for gathering information about the map layout, the resources available, and the enemy's location and strategy. You should use your scout to explore as much of the map as possible in the early game, and keep scouting throughout the game with other units, such as cavalry or monks. Scouting will help you find good spots for expansion, avoid surprises, and plan your attacks.
- Balance your economy. Your economy is the backbone of your civilization and your army. You need to balance your resource income and expenditure according to your needs and goals. You should always have enough villagers working on each resource (food, wood, gold, stone) to support your production and research. You should also avoid having too many idle villagers or too much stockpiled resources. A good rule of thumb is to have about half of your population as villagers.
- Choose the right units and upgrades. Age of Empires 2 HD has a complex and diverse unit system, with different types of units having different strengths and weaknesses. You should choose the right units for your civilization and strategy, and counter the enemy's units with appropriate units. For example, archers are good against infantry but weak against cavalry; spearmen are good against cavalry but weak against archers; siege weapons are good against buildings but weak against cavalry; etc. You should also research the upgrades that benefit your units and economy, such as blacksmith technologies, economic technologies, and unique technologies.

These are just some of the tips and tricks that can help you improve your gameplay in Age of Empires 2 HD cracked online-multiplayer. There are many more aspects to learn and master, such as build orders, strategies, tactics, micro-management, etc. The best way to learn is by playing a lot of games, watching replays and streams of better players, and practicing with friends or against AI.
