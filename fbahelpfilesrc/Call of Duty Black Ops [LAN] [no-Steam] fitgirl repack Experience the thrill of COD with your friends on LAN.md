## Step 1: Download and Install Call of Duty Black Ops Fitgirl Repack
 
The first step is to download the fitgirl repack of Call of Duty Black Ops from one of the following links:
 
- [Fitgirl Repacks](https://fitgirlrepacks.org/call-of-duty-black-ops-all-dlcs-zombies-multiplayer/) [^2^]
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/ia2oz0/call_of_duty_black_ops_multiplayer_in_lan/) [^1^]

The repack size is about 7 GB for any single language, and you can skip downloading and installing languages you don't need. The repack is based on the PLAZA release of the game, which is updated to version 0.305-05.125430.1.
 
After downloading the repack, run the setup.exe file and follow the instructions. The installation may take 30-60 minutes depending on your system. Make sure to check the integrity of the files after installation.
 
## Step 2: Use BGamerT5 or Goldberg Emulator to Enable LAN Play
 
The next step is to use one of the two alternative cracks that allow LAN play with bots or friends. You can find them in the NoDVD folder after installation.
 
BGamerT5 is a LAN/Offline client that lets you play Zombies mode and Multiplayer mode with bots. You can also join dedicated servers hosted by other players using the in-game server browser. To use BGamerT5, copy all files from NoDVD\BGamerT5 folder to your game folder, then run t5m.exe as administrator.
 
Goldberg Emulator is a Steam emulator that lets you play Multiplayer mode with friends on LAN. You can also use it to play Zombies mode offline. To use Goldberg Emulator, copy all files from NoDVD\Goldberg folder to your game folder, then run BlackOps.exe as administrator. You will need to create a text file named steam\_appid.txt in your game folder and write 42700 in it.
 
To play with friends on LAN, you will need to set up a dedicated server on one of the computers using the in-game console. To enable the console, right-click on BlackOps.exe, go to Properties, then add -console to the end of the Target field. Then launch the game and press ~ to open the console. Type /map mp\_mapname to start a server on a map of your choice (for example, /map mp\_nuked). Then tell your friends to connect to your server by typing /connect <ip>:<port> in their consoles (for example, /connect 192.168.1.100:3074).</port></ip>
