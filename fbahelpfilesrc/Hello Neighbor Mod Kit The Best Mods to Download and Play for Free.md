The Hello Neighbor Mod Kit is a free tool that lets you modify the game content and create your own mods. You can download it from the Epic Games Store[^1^] and use it with Unreal Engine 4. You can access all of the game assets, such as models, textures, sounds, animations, and blueprints, and use them to build your own neighbor's house, basement, and backyard. You can also add new gameplay elements, such as enemies, items, objectives, and events.
 
To get started with the mod kit, you need to have Hello Neighbor installed on your PC. Then, launch the Epic Games Launcher and go to the Modding tab. There, you can find the Hello Neighbor Mod Kit and install it. Once installed, you can launch it from the launcher or from the Windows Start menu.
 
The mod kit will open the Unreal Engine 4 editor, where you can create your own mod project. You can choose from a template or start from scratch. You can also browse and download existing mods from the mod browser. To learn how to use the editor and the mod kit features, you can check out the official tutorials on YouTube or read the documentation on the mod kit website.
 
Once you have created your mod, you can test it in the editor or play it in the game. You can also share it with other players by uploading it to the mod browser or exporting it as a standalone game.
