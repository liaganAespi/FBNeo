Wu Xia (also known as Dragon or Swordsmen) is a 2011 Hong Kong-Chinese martial arts film directed by Peter Chan and starring Donnie Yen, Takeshi Kaneshiro and Tang Wei. The film premiered at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival and received critical acclaim for its blend of action, drama and mystery.
 
The film follows Liu Jin Xi (Donnie Yen), a humble papermaker who lives with his wife Ayu (Tang Wei) and two sons in a remote village. One day, he intervenes in a robbery at a general store and kills two notorious bandits. His heroic act attracts the attention of Xu Bai Jiu (Takeshi Kaneshiro), a detective who suspects that Liu is hiding a dark secret. Xu discovers that Liu is actually Tang Long, a former member of the 72 Demons, a ruthless gang of killers. As Xu tries to uncover the truth, Liu's past catches up with him when his father (Jimmy Wang), the leader of the 72 Demons, comes looking for him.
