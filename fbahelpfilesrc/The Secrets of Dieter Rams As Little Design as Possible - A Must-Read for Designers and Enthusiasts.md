# Dieter Rams: As Little Design as Possible - A Book Review
 
Dieter Rams is one of the most influential product designers of the twentieth century. His work for Braun and Vitsoe has shaped the way we interact with everyday objects, from radios and clocks to juicers and shelves. His philosophy of "good design" is based on ten principles that advocate for simplicity, functionality, durability and environmental responsibility.
 
In this book, Sophie Lovell offers a comprehensive overview of Rams' life and work, with insights from his colleagues, friends and family. The book also features sketches, photographs and prototypes that reveal Rams' design process, as well as archival material and images of his house and the Braun archive. The book is a must-have for anyone interested in Rams' legacy and his ideas about how to live.

One of the most notable admirers of Rams' design is Apple, the tech giant that has revolutionized the fields of personal computing, mobile devices and digital media. Apple's products, such as the iPod, iPhone and iPad, have often been compared to Rams' creations for Braun, such as the T3 radio, the ET66 calculator and the SK4 record player. Apple's former chief design officer, Jonathan Ive, has acknowledged Rams' influence on his work and even wrote the foreword for this book.
 
Rams' design principles are also evident in Apple's software and user interface design. Apple has often paid homage to Rams' designs, for example in the looks of its podcast and calculator apps. Some say that his 1958 T3 radio -- designed with Ulm Hochschule and part of MoMA's permanent collection -- inspired the original iPod[^1^]. Apple's minimalist aesthetic, attention to detail and focus on user experience are all in line with Rams' vision of good design.
 
However, Rams himself has expressed some reservations about Apple's products and practices. In a 2018 documentary by Gary Hustwit, titled "Rams", he criticized Apple for creating products that are not durable or environmentally friendly, and for contributing to a culture of consumerism and obsolescence. He also questioned whether Apple's products are truly innovative or just variations on existing ideas. Rams said that he admires Apple's design team, but he is not happy with some of their decisions.
  
Rams' design legacy is not only reflected in the products we use today, but also in the exhibitions and publications that celebrate his work and ideas. Rams has been the subject of several retrospectives and monographs, such as "Less and More: The Design Ethos of Dieter Rams" (2009), "Dieter Rams: As Little Design as Possible" (2011) and "Dieter Rams: The Complete Works" (2020). His designs have been displayed in museums and galleries around the world, such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Design Museum in London and the Vitra Design Museum in Germany.

One of the most recent and comprehensive exhibitions of Rams' work is "Dieter Rams. A Style Room", a permanent display at the Museum Angewandte Kunst in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. The exhibition, which opened in 2021 to mark Rams' 90th birthday, showcases over 300 objects designed by Rams for Braun and Vitsoe, as well as sketches, models, photographs and documents. The exhibition also features a reconstruction of Rams' living room, where he displays his own collection of furniture, art and objects. The exhibition aims to illustrate Rams' design philosophy and his influence on contemporary culture.
 
The exhibition is accompanied by a catalogue that includes essays by experts and interviews with Rams himself. The catalogue also contains a foreword by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who praises Rams as "one of the most important designers of our time" and "a role model for generations of designers". The exhibition and the catalogue are a testament to Rams' enduring relevance and impact on the world of design.
